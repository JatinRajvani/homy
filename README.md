# Project Name : Homey
<!-- # Project Documentation -->
# **[Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/R2f2wshOqW1dTsLohjxesv/Project2?node-id=0-1&t=6Ufb3m1YsvJEx2sG-1)**

## 📖 Project Info
Homey is a **comprehensive platform** designed to assist students, corporate workers, and other users in finding essential services such as:
- 🏠 **Hostel & PG Finding Service** – Easily search and explore hostels, PGs, and rental accommodations.
- 🍱 **Home-Made Meal Service** – Access delicious and hygienic home-cooked food through a tiffin service.




## ❗ Problem Statement
  Currently, there is no single platform that provides all these essential services—hostel and PG finding, home-made food delivery, transportation information, and community engagement—in one place. Users have to navigate multiple websites and applications to access these services, making the process time-consuming and inefficient. Our website **solves this problem** by integrating all these features into a single, user-friendly platform, making life easier for students, corporate employees, and other users.



## 🚀 Our Solution
 By bringing all these features together in one platform, we eliminate the hassle of switching between different services. Users can find hostels, order home-made meals, get transportation details, and connect with others—all in one place.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Advanced Search** – Filter hostels and PGs based on location, price, and amenities.
- 📜 **Detailed Listings** – View complete details of each hostel, including pricing, facilities, and ratings.
- 🍽️ **Custom Meal Orders** – Personalize your meal preferences and get food delivered.

## 🎯 Target Audience
- 🏫 **Students** – Those searching for hostels, PGs, and affordable meal options near their institutions.
- 👔 **Corporate Workers** – Employees who need rental accommodations and reliable meal services.
- 🌍 **Newcomers & Migrants** – People moving to a new city who need all essential services in one place.
